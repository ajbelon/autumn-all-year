                <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 350&deg;F.</li>
                    <li>Blend all ingredients in a food processor.</li>
                    <li>You can add seasonings of choice to your pizza "dough".  Italian seasoning, crushed red pepper flakes, etc.</li>
                    <li>Spread mixture onto a silicon lined (or parchment lined) baking sheet.  The texture should be similar to mashed potatoes.  Just spread out into desired pizza shape about 1.2 inch thick.</li>
                    <li>Bake for approximately 18 mins.  Remove from oven.  Using a spatula, flip the crust, return to oven, and cook for approximately 5 more mins.</li>
                    <li>Remove from oven and add toppings of choice.  Return to oven for a few more mins to thoroughly heat all toppings and melt any cheese (if added).  Watch the pizza at this stage to ensure the ends of the crust do not burn.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Substitutions/Additions</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>This crust recipe is pretty forgiving.  I’ve made this several times with just one egg and it comes out more crackery. Two eggs was a bit more bready. Both are good!  Just different.</li>
                    <li>You can use a variety of grated cheeses. Today I used Colby jack. Grated mozzarella is also very good. I’ve used cheddar before and it comes out more greasy because cheddar is just a more oily cheese, but it’s still really good. I just wouldn’t use anything super wet like fresh mozzarella. </li>
                    <li>Though this crust is made with cheese, adding more cheese on top is a nice addition.</li>
                    <li>If you're adding sauce, make sure not to add a marinara, which is quite wet.  This will make your crust soggy.  Instead, opt for a well cooked pizza sauce, which has had more of the water cooked out and will be less likely to yield a soggy crust.  A white sauce is also quite good on this.</li>
                    <li>This recipe can also be used to make garlic bread.  Just add garlic when processing the dough in the food processor.  Then just top with cheese of choice for a cheesy garlic bread</li>
                    <li> This recipe also works well for biscuits.  Just form them into drop-biscuit shape, bake, and top with sausage gravy for a delicious  meat based biscuits and gravy!</li>
                </ul>
